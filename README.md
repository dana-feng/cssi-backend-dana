#CSSI-FINAL-PROJECT Version 2

Chrome extension that allows users to set break and screen times, and uses animation and a timer to let the user know when to take a break and when to study. Collaborated with two other cssi students to create.

Version 1 of this project can be found in JermXT/VisionChromeExtension, where I did not implement the backend of the chrome extension. Version 2 is where I did implement the backend of the chrome extension. 

The music used is Christmas Village by Aaron Kenny
